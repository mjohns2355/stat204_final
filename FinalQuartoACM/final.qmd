### 5.1.1 1. Introduction (≈0.75-1 page)

-   Research question or paper overview

-   Background and motivation (make sure to include proper citations)

-   Starting sample reference [@yannakakis_ai_2005]

-   Dataset description (source, size, key variables)

-   Study objectives

### 5.1.2 2. Exploratory Data Analysis (≈1-1.5 pages)

-   Summary statistics

-   Data visualization (2-3 key plots)

-   Data quality assessment (missing values, outliers, distributions)

-   Preliminary insights that inform modeling choices

**Track 1 (Paper Reproduction) should include:**

-   A combination of original EDA and useful pieces of the EDA presented in the paper. If you use/reproduce a plot from the original paper in your report, give credit to the authors in the source.

### 5.1.3 3. Methods (≈1-1.5 pages)

**Track 1 (Paper Reproduction) should include:**

-   Short explanation of the methods used in the original paper

-   Proposed extension or alternative model (following the next section details)

**Both tracks should include:**

-   **Statistical models used** with mathematical notation where appropriate

    -   For regression: specify model equation, link function (if applicable), assumptions

    -   For PCA: explain dimensionality reduction approach

    -   For clustering: describe method and distance metric

    -   For regularization: specify penalty type and selection procedure

-   **Why these methods?** Connect to research questions and data structure

-   Software and key R packages used (don’t forget to cite the R packages)

### 5.1.4 4. Results (≈2-2.5 pages)

**Track 1 (Paper Reproduction) should include:**

-   Summary of reproduction success/challenges

-   What did the original authors do well? What could be improved?

-   Summary of results with proposed model following the next section details.

**Both tracks should include:**

-   Model fitting and diagnostics

    -   Assumption checking (residual plots, normality tests, etc.)

    -   Model comparison (if applicable)

    -   Goodness-of-fit measures

-   Parameter interpretation with confidence intervals where appropriate

-   Key findings presented with visualizations

### 5.1.5 5. Discussion & Conclusion (≈0.75-1 page)

**Both tracks should include:**

-   Answers to research questions with supporting evidence

-   Practical implications or insights

-   Limitations and assumptions

-   Future directions

**Track 1 (Reproduction) should include:**

-   A summary of what could be improved in the original paper and how your new analysis does exactly that.

### 5.1.6 6. References

-   Not included in page count

-   Use consistent citation style (APA, Chicago, or similar)

-   Include at least 2-3 references beyond the dataset source
